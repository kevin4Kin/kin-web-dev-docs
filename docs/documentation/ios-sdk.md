title: Kin SDK for iOS
---

With the Kin SDK for iOS you can give your users fun ways to earn and spend Kin in your app, and help us build a whole new digital world.

Kin SDK for iOS is implemented as a library that can be incorporated into your code. If you’re just getting started with Kin ecosystem we suggest you spend a few minutes reading this [overview of the Kin architecture](../kin-architecture-overview.md).

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile`.
```
pod 'KinSDK', '~> 0.8.1’
```

See the latest releases at [github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-ios/releases](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-ios/releases).

The main repository is at [github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-ios](https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-ios).

### Sub-project

1. Clone this repo (as a submodule or in a different directory, it's up to you).
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-sdk-ios
```
2. Drag `KinSDK.xcodeproj` into your xcode project as a subproject.
3. In your main `.xcodeproj` file, select the desired target(s).
4. Go to **Build Phases**, expand Target Dependencies, and add `KinSDK`.
5. In Swift, `import KinSDK` and you are good to go! (We haven't yet tested Objective-C.)


## API overview

Adding Kin features to your app means using the SDK to:

- Access the Kin Blockchain
- Manage Kin accounts
- Execute transactions against Kin accounts

The two main classes of the Kin SDK for iOS are `KinClient` and `KinAccount`.

### KinClient

iOS apps that allow users to earn, spend, and manage Kin are considered clients in the Kin architecture. The following statement creates a `KinClient` object which includes methods to manage accounts on the Kin Blockchain.

A `KinClient` object is initialized for a specific Kin environment and network and it manages `KinAccount` objects for that environment.

```swift
KinClient(with: URL, network: Network, appId: AppId)
```

- `with` The URL of the Horizon server providing access to the Kin Blockchain
- `network` You declare which Kin Blockchain network you want to work with using the predefined enum value `Network.mainNet` or `Network.playground`.
- `appId` must be a 4-character string which identifies your application. It must contain only digits and upper and/or lower case letters.

For instance, to initialize a Kin Client to use the Playground network.
```swift
let url = "http://horizon-testnet.kininfrastructure.com"
guard let providerUrl = URL(string: url) else {
    return nil
}
do {
    let appId = try AppId("test")
    let kinClient = KinClient(with: providerUrl, network: .testNet, appId: appId)
}
catch let error {
    print("Error \(error)")
}
```


### KinAccount

With a `KinClient` object, it is possible to add a new account, delete or import an account and access a list of accounts using a `KinAccount` object.

```swift
var accounts: KinAccounts

func addAccount() throws -> KinAccount

func deleteAccount(at index: Int) throws

func importAccount(_ jsonString: String, passphrase: String) throws -> KinAccount

```

#### Accessing accounts

The list of Kin accounts of a KinClient are available via its attribute `accounts`.

```swift
var accounts: KinAccounts
```

To get the first account: `let account = kinClient.accounts.first`

or `let account = kinClient.accounts[0]`

To print the public address of each stored account:

```swift
kinClient.accounts.forEach { account in
    print("--> \(account?.publicAddress)")
}
```

#### Creating an account

Once the `KinClient` object is initialized, you need at least one `KinAccount` object to use the features from the Kin ecosystem.
Every account created or imported with `KinClient` is also securely stored locally by `KinClient`.

To create an account:

```swift
do {
    let account = try kinClient.addAccount()
}
catch let error {
    print("Error creating an account \(error)")
}
```

#### Deleting an account

Deleting an account means removing the account data stored locally.

**Note:** If the account has not been backed up previously by exporting it, it will be lost and its Kin inaccessible.

Deleting the first account:
```swift
do {
    try kinClient.deleteAccount(at: 0)
}
catch let error {
    print("Could not delete account \(error)")
}
```

#### Importing an account

The following snippet adds to the list of accounts managed by `KinClient`. The passphrase `a-secret-passphrase-here` must be identical to the one used when exporting the account(s).

```swift
let json = "{\"pkey\":\"GBKN6ATMTFQOKDIJOUUP6G7A7GFAQ6XHJBV3HJ5QAQH3NCUQNXISH3AR\"," +
        "\"seed\":\"61381366f4af2c57c55e2c23411e26d5a85eae18a9e1c91e01fa7e9967f3d2b9e0f8a412c9147d7abe1529adcaef21a84ebc266da0a86b0f6a9adf2b3007652811ceaa4156834620\",\"salt\":\"a663ec77c54bb2c9efdffabb5685cda9\"}"
do {
    try kinClient.importAccount(json, passphrase: "a-secret-passphrase-here")
}
catch let error {
    print("Error importing the account \(error)")
}
```

## Using a Kin account

### Creating an account on the Kin Blockchain

When you create an account using `kinClient.addAccount`, you have created and securely stored a keypair locally but have not yet created an account on the Kin Blockchain.

The following snippet creates the account on the Playground blockchain.

```swift
/**
Create the given stored account on the playground blockchain.
*/
func createPlaygroundAccountOnBlockchain(account: KinAccount, completionHandler: @escaping (([String: Any]?) -> ())) {
    // Playground blockchain URL for account creation
    let createUrlString = "http://friendbot-testnet.kininfrastructure.com?addr=\(account.publicAddress)"

    guard let createUrl = URL(string: createUrlString) else {
        return
    }
    let request = URLRequest(url: createUrl)
    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { (data: Data?, response: URLResponse?, error: Error?) in
        if let error = error {
            print("Account creation on playground blockchain failed with error: \(error)")
            completionHandler(nil)
            return
        }
        guard let data = data,
              let json = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []),
              let result = json as? [String: Any] else {
            print("Account creation on playground blockchain failed with no parsable JSON")
            completionHandler(nil)
            return
        }
        // check if there's a bad status
        guard result["status"] == nil else {
            print("Error status \(result)")
            completionHandler(nil)
            return
        }
        print("Account creation on playground blockchain was successful with response data: \(result)")
        completionHandler(result)
    }

    task.resume()
}
```

### Kin account identification

A Kin account is identified via the public-address half of its keypair. Retrieve this string with `publicAddress`.

```swift
var publicAddress: String = account.publicAddress
```

Before an account can be used on the blockchain it must be funded with some Kin. When working in the playground environment, funding occurs via the Friendbot service. In the production environment, initial funding of user accounts is typically provided by developers like you from funds provided by Kin Foundation. For more information see [Friendbot](../kin-architecture-overview#friendbot)

### Kin account status

The current account status on the blockchain is queried with `status`.

```swift
func status(completion: @escaping (AccountStatus?, Error?) -> Void)
```
An account’s status is either `.created` or `.notCreated`. If an account only exists locally after a call to `kinClient.addAccount()`, its status will still be `.notCreated`.

### Kin balance

To retrieve the account's current balance in Kin:

```swift
func balance(completion: @escaping BalanceCompletion)
```

- `completion` callback method called with `Kin`, `Error`

### Sending Kin to another account

To transfer Kin to another account, you need the public address of the account to which you want to transfer Kin.

Like most blockchains, by default every transaction on the Kin Blockchain is charged a fee to execute. This discourages blockchain spam and denial of service attacks.  Fee for individual transactions are trivial (1 KIN = 10E5 Fee).

A whitelist of pre-approved Kin apps have their fee waived. See [Send Whitelisted Transaction](#send-kin-with-a-whitelist-transaction-fee-waived) for an example.


#### Send Kin with a transaction (not Whitelisted)

Transactions are executed on the Kin Blockchain in a two-step process:

- **Build** the transaction which includes the calculation of the transaction hash. The transaction hash is used as an ID and is necessary to query the status of the transaction.
- **Send** the transaction for execution on the blockchain.

##### Build the transaction

```swift
func generateTransaction(to recipient: String,
                             kin: Kin,
                             memo: String?,
                             fee: Stroop,
                             completion: @escaping GenerateTransactionCompletion)
```

- `recipient` is the recipient's public address.
- `kin` is the amount of Kin to be sent.
- `memo` is an optional string, up-to 28 bytes in length, included on the transaction record. A typical usage is to include an order number..
- `fee` The fee in `Stroop`s used if the transaction is not whitelisted. (1 KIN = 10E5 Stroop.)
- `completion` callback method called with the `TransactionEnvelope` and `Error`.

##### Send the transaction

```swift
func sendTransaction(_ transactionEnvelope: TransactionEnvelope,
                       completion: @escaping SendTransactionCompletion)
```

- `transactionEnvelope`: The `TransactionEnvelope` object to send.
- `completion`: A completion callback method with the `TransactionId` or `Error`.

#### Send Kin with a Whitelist transaction (Fee waived)
The following paragraphs describe the process of whitelisting a transaction. If you want to skip the explanation and jump straight to a code example, see [Send Kin with a whitelist transaction](../quick-start/hi-kin-ios#send-kin-with-a-whitelist-transaction) code included in the [Hello World for iOS](../quick-start/hi-kin-ios) tutorial.

Transactions are executed on the Kin Blockchain in a two-step process:

- **Build** the transaction which includes the calculation of the transaction hash. The transaction hash is used as an ID and is necessary to query the status of the transaction.
- Create a `WhitelistEnvelope`
- **Send** the `WhitelistEnvelope` to a whitelist service which will sign and return an new `TransactionEnvelope`.
- **Send** the transaction for execution on the blockchain.

Pass the returned `TransactionEnvelope` to the `WhitelistEnvelope`.

```swift
init(transactionEnvelope: TransactionEnvelope, networkId: Network.Id)
```

The `WhitelistEnvelope` should be passed to a server for signing. The server response should be a  `TransactionEnvelope` with a second signature, which can then be sent.

```swift
func sendTransaction(_ transactionEnvelope: TransactionEnvelope,
                       completion: @escaping SendTransactionCompletion)
```

## Miscellaneous

### Asynchronous programming styles

Several asynchronous methods of `KinClient` and `KinAccount` come in two styles:

- **Callback parameter**: a completion handler is passed as a parameter to the method.
- **Promise**: a `Promise` object is returned by the method. The `Promise` class comes with the Kin Util library which is included in the SDK. Promises are a way to simplify asynchronous programming and make asynchronous method calls composable.

Obtain `KinAccount` status using the completion parameter:
```swift
func status(completion: @escaping (AccountStatus?, Error?) -> Void)
```

Obtain `KinAccount` status using promises:

```swift
func status() -> Promise<AccountStatus>
```

A more complete example:

```swift
account.status()
    .then { (status: AccountStatus) in
        print("Account's status is: \(status)")
    }
    .error { (error: Error) in
        print("Error getting the account's status: \(error)")
    }
```

### `KinAccount` watcher objects

To be notified of changes on a `KinAccount`, you can also use watcher objects. The watcher object will emit an event whenever a change occurs.

Watcher objects are available for:

- Account creation
```swift
func watchCreation() throws -> Promise<Void>
```
- Balance changes
```swift
func watchBalance(_ balance: Kin?) throws -> BalanceWatch
```
- Payments
```swift
func watchPayments(cursor: String?) throws -> PaymentWatch
```

### Error handling

Kin SDK for iOS wraps errors in extensions of methods of `KinAccount`, for example `StellarError.missingAccount`.

The underlying error is the actual cause of failure.

### Common errors

`StellarError.missingAccount`: The account does not exist on the Kin Blockchain.
You must create the account by issuing an operation with `KinAccount.publicAddress` as the destination.
This is done using an app-specific service, and is outside thee scope of this SDK.
